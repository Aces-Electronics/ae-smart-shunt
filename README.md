# Looking to get up and running?
- [Wiki - Quickstart Guide](../../wiki/Quickstart-Guide)

# Project Goals:
The overall goal of this project is to make a simple, robust and reliable Ssmart batery shunt to monitor voltage, current and power of a lithium battery, or battery system.

# Design goals:  
- Smallest form-factor possible while being able to handle large currents, upwards of 300A, without getting too hot
- Zero maintenance
- Allow the data to be accessed from an OLED gauge, via BLE or ESPNow

# v0.0.1
Version 0.0.1 has been prototyped. I will hand assemble some test boards and do some testing. ~ETA for completion is 10/8/25.
