# Companion App for Smart Shunt

This directory will contain the source code for the Flutter-based companion app for the Smart Shunt project.

The app will connect to the shunt via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and display real-time telemetry data, such as:

*   Battery Voltage
*   Current
*   Power
*   State of Charge (SOC)
*   Remaining Battery Capacity
*   Starter Battery Voltage
*   Calibration Status

The UI will be inspired by the Victron Connect app, providing a clean and user-friendly way to monitor the battery system.
